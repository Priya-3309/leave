The core aim of this application is to provide students with a streamlined way to request leave for urgent academic matters, such as classes and exams. The primary focus is to minimize the administrative workload on college staff.

We proudly present "College Duty Leave" (CDL), a collaborative effort by myself and my talented team members: Juby, Richa, and Riya. CDL represents our mini project, and we're hopeful that it will create a positive impact within the college community.

Key features of the application include fields to explain the leave reason, specify its duration, and upload any necessary documents. Moreover, the platform offers automated notifications to relevant staff members, real-time updates on leave application statuses, and a feature to track application progress. This system not only provides an intuitive interface for students but also significantly lightens the workload for college staff.

# CDL incorporates three distinct interfaces:
## üéì Students Interface: This intuitive interface simplifies leave requests submission and offers real-time notifications on their status.

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Faculty Interface: For faculty members, our interface streamlines the review and approval/rejection of student leave requests, enhancing overall efficiency.

## üë®‚Äçüíº HOD Interface: Heads of Departments benefit from a consolidated view of leave requests, enabling well-informed and timely decisions.

What sets CDL apart is its automatic notifications, creating a closed communication loop. As leave requests progress through the approval process, students stay informed, minimizing uncertainty.

In summary, I take immense pride in our developed website. The project was indeed challenging, but the outcome is highly satisfying.

Should you want to delve deeper into this project or explore other web development initiatives, I'm more than willing to engage. Your attention is greatly appreciated, and I eagerly anticipate any future discussions.
